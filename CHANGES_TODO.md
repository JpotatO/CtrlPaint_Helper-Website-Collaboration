### <u>To-do:</u>

+ Upload the .MP3 files extracted audio from original videos, to work with TranscriberAG (read only song files, and only a few types)

+ <strong>Create the *perfect* workaround for Subtitles making with AHD Subtitle Maker Professional:</strong>
  + Export a TXT file from TranscriberAG (Attention, the times is shown as seconds only)
  + Open the exported TXT with the notepad.exe (or alike)
  + Open the original video in AHD Subtitle Maker Pro
  + start creating subtitles based on the time of the TXT file
    + we can only see the start times of voices entries, then the second entry is the en time (eg: if the first is 35.975 sec and the second is 38.014, then the result is 35.975 --> 38.014, or 00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.014, it's a little tricky and a long work)

+ <strong>Need verifications for Transcripted & Subtitled entries:</strong>
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/01) Digital Painting 101/01.Introduction.md
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/01) Digital Painting 101/02.Brushes and Erasers.md

+ <strong>Need to complete or rebuild the Transcription and/or Subtitles, before re-checking, for:</strong>

  + English (Original)/Video Guides/\02) Traditional Drawing/02.Unplugged Pencils and Erasers.md
