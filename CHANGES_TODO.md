Changes:

2015.07.09:

+ Added «Generic content» to all the .md files related to the videos.

+ Added «2.Video Content» and «3.Homework» (when available) to :
  + «01) Digital Painting 101 > ALL FILES .md»
  + «02) Traditional Drawing > ALL FILES .md»

+ Unfinished and released subtitles for «02) Traditional Drawing > 02.unplugged Pencils and Erasers.md»

+ Finished and uploaded subtitles for «1.Video Library - Overview.md»

+ Finished creating and uploaded subtitles for the «1) Digital Painting 101 > 1_Intro 1of5.md»

To-do:

+ Upload the .MP3 files extracted audio from original videos, to work with TranscriberAG (read only song files, and only a few types)

+ Create the perfect workaround for Subtitles making with AHD Subtitle Maker Professional:
  + Export a TXT file from TranscriberAG (Attention, the times is shown as seconds only)
  + Open the exported TXT with the notepad.exe (or alike)
  + Open the original video in AHD Subtitle Maker Pro
  + start creating subtitles based on the time of the TXT file
    + we can only see the start times of voices entries, then the second entry is the en time (eg: if the first is 35.975 sec and the second is 38.014, then the result is 35.975 --> 38.014, or 00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.014, it's a little tricky and a long work)

*Making transcripted content is a long work (more harder for non-native english in this case), same with subtitles, personaly it take me 1 hour for a 9 minutes video to transcript, and 2 hours to make the subtitles… need to find a way to modify easily the exported file from TranscriberAG and import it in AHD Subtitle Maker Pro*
