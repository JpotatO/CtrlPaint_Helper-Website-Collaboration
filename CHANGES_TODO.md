<h3><u>To-do:</u></h3>

+ Upload the .MP3 files extracted audio from original videos, <s>to work with TranscriberAG (read only song files, and only a few types)</s>

+ ! ERROR: Switching to the perfect Transcription and Subtitle maker "Subtitle Edit", all theses data will be deleted later ! :
+ <strong>Create the *perfect* workaround for <s>Subtitles making with AHD Subtitle Maker Professional</s>:</strong>
  + <s>Export a TXT file from TranscriberAG (Attention, the times is shown as seconds only)</s>
  + <s>Open the exported TXT with the notepad.exe (or alike)</s>
  + <s>Open the original video in AHD Subtitle Maker Pro</s>
  + <s>start creating subtitles based on the time of the TXT file</s>
    + <s>we can only see the start times of voices entries, then the second entry is the en time (eg: if the first is 35.975 sec and the second is 38.014, then the result is 35.975 --> 38.014, or 00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.014, it's a little tricky and a long work)</s>

<hr/>
+ <strong>Need verifications for Transcripted & Subtitled entries:</strong>
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/01) Digital Painting 101/01.Introduction.md
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/01) Digital Painting 101/02.Brushes and Erasers.md

+ <strong>Need to complete or rebuild the Transcription and/or Subtitles, before re-checking, for:</strong>
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/1.CtrlPaint Video Library - Overview.md
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/02) Traditional Drawing/01.Ctrl+Paint Unplugged Road-Map.md
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/02) Traditional Drawing/02.Unplugged Pencils and Erasers.md
  + English (Original)/Video Guides/02) Traditional Drawing/03.Introducing the pencil.md

<h3>Table tracking for <strong>English (Original) Translation</strong>:</h3>
**Attention: At the moment this is a try**, I have an issue and can't use 2 checkbox on the same line in markdown… I will then use the inspect function of Firefox Developer version, to find the source .cgi (or .js maybe) of the github checkbox system, then I let the MarkDown for now.

+ Need to find the original scripts to create Checked or Unchecked and locked checkboxs.<br/>
+ Use local hyperlinks, to redirect to the related file in the table, from the current Branch (ie [File.md](/File.md) on this page it will become https://github.com/JpotatO/CtrlPaint_Helper-Website-Collaboration/tree/JpotatO/File.md - if I remember the process from Customize.org)<br/>
+ Add all Files and categories, when this table is fully working, create a separate file in the Translation Root Folder, theses files will be paired with each translation.
