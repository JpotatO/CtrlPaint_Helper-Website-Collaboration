<h3><u>About:</u></h3>
At first I wanted to use <strong><a href="http//penflip.com">Penflip</a> to manage and collaborate on the translations</strong> of all the existing text on the <strong>TeamL2D's helper website</strong>, for the <strong>Videos subtitles</strong> and for the <strong>original content that Matt Kohr write I need to add that I have his approval to make the transcriptions, the subtitles ans translations, but I need to see with him how to share videos from this big work (surely on youtube, in multiple playlists based on original "Chapters")</strong>.

Penflip is a <strong>platform similar to GitHub</strong> oriented for Writers, there is a main Content (called <strong>Master</strong>) and users create copies (called <strong>Branches</strong>) enabling them to modify the content without deleting anything of the main content, and we can manage the Branches when we receive new <strong>Submissions</strong> from users.

First you need to know that all the data on the Forums and all the content that the users can edit <strong>need to be in English</strong>, the reason is that it's not possible to translate all things in real time, but modules like <em>Facebook Comments</em> propose an integrated translate engine.
Then if you want to communicate with us or other users easily and <strong>have quick response</strong> rate, think to write in English, thanks for you understanding.

<em style="color:red">×It's possible that our forums will integrate a localized interface, but we can't guarantee that all content by user's and moderators will be translated in your language.<br/>
×This file is only used to set the structure of the penflip entries.</em>

<h3><u>Penflip Directories Structure:</u></h3>
<ul><li><strong><u>Localized language:</u></strong><br/>
  Contain all files of a defined language (ie: English folder will contain the Text content from the homepage, the video gallery--> Video Name--> Subtitles and texts, etc…)
  The users need to duplicate this Parent folder, rename it in the selected language (ie: if the user want to translate from English to German, duplicate the English translation and rename the folder "German") [!] Need to use GitHub desktop app for more flexibility, or let admins do it.</li>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video «Gallery»:</u></strong><br/>
It's the pages displaying original video description and information, more importantly the Homework and Details.
Here's how we manage the video contents:</li>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Category:</u></strong><br/>
Name of the category from the CtrlPaint Library (ie: Digital Painting 101).</li>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Name:</u></strong><br/>
The actual name of the video (ie: Digital painting 101 - Intro (1 of 5)).</li>
<ul><li><strong><u>Subtitles:</u></strong><br/>
All the text extracted from the original videos in subtitles file format (we use multi-software subtitles integration, like *.txt that is the most basic).</li>
<li><strong><u>Texts:</u></strong><br/>
The video description, informations, guides and Homework.</li></ul></ul></ul>
<li><strong><u>Homepage:</u></strong><br/>
All text content displayed on the Home page (except embeding contents).<br/>
<li><strong><u>About:</u></strong><br/>
Display informations on <strong>Ctrl+Paint</strong> and <strong>Matt KOHR</strong>, the <strong>TeamL2D&Company</strong> and <strong>Jordan GROSS (JpotatO)</strong>, the usage of the site (and legal but in English in this case).</li>
