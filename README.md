<s>There is a bug with this file after a conflict (you can see one of them at the end of it), it will be repaired shortly.</s>

Just tested the «Subtitle Edit» software by [Nikse.dk](http://www.nikse.dk), and it reduced my work time by more than 60% !
Then don't follow things speaking of TranscriberAG ans AHD Subtitle Maker Pro, I will rewrite all entries concerning them.
But think to come see the [Issues section](https://github.com/JpotatO/CtrlPaint_Helper-Website-Collaboration/issues) that will be used to discuss any subjects of this project.

Read the **HOWTO.md** to know what tools you need, and how you need to work with them, and how to work on Github, like to create new translations or just share new transcriptions/Subtitles.

Read the **CHANGE_TODO.md** to see what is already released and what need to be done quickly, there is a list of all files to do, the last changes and other informations.

<h3><u>About:</u></h3>
At first I wanted to use <strong><a href="http//penflip.com">Penflip</a> to manage and collaborate on the translations</strong> of all the existing text of the <strong>TeamL2D's helper website</strong>, for the <strong>Videos subtitles</strong> and for the <strong>original content that Matt Kohr write</strong>, but it's more limited than GitHub.

**I need to add that I have the approval of Matt Kohr** to make the transcriptions, the subtitles, translations, and the website, but I need to see with him how to share videos from this big work (surely on youtube, in multiple playlists based on original "Chapters").

on Github, there is a main Content (called <strong>Master</strong> usualy) and users create copies (called <strong>Branches</strong>) enabling them to modify the content without deleting anything of the main content, and we can manage the Branches when we receive new <strong>Submissions</strong> from users.


You need to know that on our websites and forums, all the data and content that the users can edit <strong>need to be in English</strong>, the reason is that it's not possible to translate all things in real time, but modules like <em>Facebook Comments</em> propose an integrated translate engine.
Then if you want to communicate with us or other users easily and <strong>have quick response</strong> rate, think to write in English, thanks for you understanding.

<em style="color:red">×It's possible that our forums will integrate a localized interface, but we can't guarantee that all content by user's and moderators will be translated in your language.<br/>
×This file is only intended to set the structure of the entries structure.</em>

<h3><u>Directories Structure:</u></h3>
<ul><li><strong><u>Localized language:</u></strong><br/>
  Contain all files of a defined language (ie: English folder will contain the Text content from the homepage, the video gallery--> Video Name--> Subtitles and texts, etc…)</br>
  The users need to duplicate this Parent folder, rename it in the selected language (ie: if the user want to translate from English to German, duplicate the English translation and rename the folder "German")</br>
  [!] Need to use GitHub desktop app for more flexibility, or let admins do it.</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video «Gallery»:</u></strong><br/>
It's the pages displaying original video description and information, more importantly the Homework and Details.
Here's how we manage the video contents:</li><br/>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Category:</u></strong><br/>
Name of the category from the CtrlPaint Library (ie: Digital Painting 101).</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Name:</u></strong><br/>
The actual name of the video (ie: Digital painting 101 - Intro (1 of 5)).</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Subtitles:</u></strong><br/>
All the text extracted from the original videos in subtitles file format (we use multi-software subtitles integration, like *.txt that is the most basic).</li><br/>
<li><strong><u>Texts:</u></strong><br/>
The video description, informations, guides and Homework.</li></ul></ul></ul></br>
<li><strong><u>Homepage:</u></strong><br/>
All text content displayed on the Home page (except embeding contents).<br/>
<li><strong><u>About:</u></strong><br/>
Display informations on <strong>Ctrl+Paint</strong> and <strong>Matt KOHR</strong>, the <strong>TeamL2D&Company</strong> and <strong>Jordan GROSS (JpotatO)</strong>, the usage of the site (and legal but in English in this case).</li><br/>
