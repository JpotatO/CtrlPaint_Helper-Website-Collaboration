<h3><u>Important Messages:</u></h3>
**2015.07.19:**  
The Video files in a ```*.MP4``` format are now available on MediaFire, and the links will be integrated on this Repository, in the file that have the list of all videos.  

At the moment I uploaded the Chapters:  
```0a_Library Overview, 0b_Let's Paint, 1_Digital Painting 1O1, 2_Traditional Drawing, 3_Drawing 2, 4_Composition Basics, 5_Using Reference Materials, 6_Anatomy, 7_Perspective, 8_The Brush Tool```  
and the folders contain all the videos, some that have a sub-folder named ```Subtitled``` have already their subtitles files completed partialy or entirely.  

Anyway refer to the video list -in the [**CHANGES_TODO.md**](/CHANGES_TODO.md) at this moment- to know what is already subtitled, what is not, and what need to be checked.  

>The problem is that without a **premium account** it's not possible to download more than one file at a time - but it's possible to download them at the same time, but not in one download - then I recommend you to [create a Mediafire](http://mediafire.com "homepage: mediafire.com") account, **follow the Folder that contain the videos** and use **MediaFire desktop** to download (synchronize) all files of the followed folder.

*But, if you need only one video you can simply download and start working with it, after checking the [**CHANGES_TODO.md**](/CHANGES_TODO.md) file.*  

**Attention: there is a File ```*.txt``` with some rules to follow with this content, the most important part is that you don't have any rights to release theses videos, much less if the original author didn't approve.**

<s>There is a bug with this file after a conflict (you can see one of them at the end of it), it will be repaired shortly.</s>

**2015.07.13:**  
Just tested the «Subtitle Edit» software by [Nikse.dk](http://www.nikse.dk "Homepage: Subtitle Edit"), and it reduced my work time by more than 60% !
Then don't follow things speaking of TranscriberAG ans AHD Subtitle Maker Pro, I will rewrite all entries concerning them.
But think to come see the [Issues section](https://github.com/JpotatO/CtrlPaint_Helper-Website-Collaboration/issues "Message board of this Repository") that will be used to discuss any subjects of this project.

Read the [**HOWTO.md**](/HOWTO.md) to know what tools you need, and how you need to work with them, and how to work on Github, like to create new translations or just share new transcriptions/Subtitles.

Read the [**CHANGES_TODO.md**](/CHANGES_TODO.md) to see what is already released and what need to be done quickly, there is a list of all files to do, the last changes and other informations.

<h3><u>About:</u></h3>
At first I wanted to use <strong><a href="http//penflip.com" title="Penflip.com">Penflip</a> to manage and collaborate on the translations</strong> of all the existing text of the <strong>TeamL2D's helper website</strong>, for the <strong>Videos subtitles</strong> and for the <strong>original content that Matt Kohr write</strong>, but it's more limited than GitHub.

**I need to add that I have the approval of Matt Kohr** to make the transcriptions, the subtitles, translations, and the website, but I need to see with him how to share videos from this big work (surely on youtube, in multiple playlists based on original "Chapters").

on Github, there is a main Content (called <strong>Master</strong> usualy) and users create copies (called <strong>Branches</strong>) enabling them to modify the content without deleting anything of the main content, and we can manage the Branches when we receive new <strong>Submissions</strong> from users.


You need to know that on our websites and forums, all the data and content that the users can edit <strong>need to be in English</strong>, the reason is that it's not possible to translate all things in real time, but modules like <em>Facebook Comments</em> propose an integrated translate engine.
Then if you want to communicate with us or other users easily and <strong>have quick response</strong> rate, think to write in English, thanks for you understanding.

<em style="color:red">×It's possible that our forums will integrate a localized interface, but we can't guarantee that all content by user's and moderators will be translated in your language.<br/>
×This file is only intended to set the structure of the entries structure.</em>
<hr/>
<h3><u>Directories Structure:</u></h3>
<blockquote style="background-color:lightblue">
<ul><li><strong><u>Localized language:</u></strong><br/>
  Contain all files of a defined language (ie: English folder will contain the Text content from the homepage, the video gallery--> Video Name--> Subtitles and texts, etc…)</br>
  The users need to duplicate this Parent folder, rename it in the selected language (ie: if the user want to translate from English to German, duplicate the English translation and rename the folder "German")</br>
  [!] Need to use GitHub desktop app for more flexibility, or let admins do it.</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video «Gallery»:</u></strong><br/>
It's the pages displaying original video description and information, more importantly the Homework and Details.
Here's how we manage the video contents:</li><br/>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Category:</u></strong><br/>
Name of the category from the CtrlPaint Library (ie: Digital Painting 101).</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Video Name:</u></strong><br/>
The actual name of the video (ie: Digital painting 101 - Intro (1 of 5)).</li></br>
<ul><li><strong><u>Subtitles:</u></strong><br/>
All the text extracted from the original videos in subtitles file format (we use multi-software subtitles integration, like *.txt that is the most basic).</li><br/>
<li><strong><u>Texts:</u></strong><br/>
The video description, informations, guides and Homework.</li></ul></ul></ul></br>
<li><strong><u>Homepage:</u></strong><br/>
All text content displayed on the Home page (except embeding contents).<br/>
<li><strong><u>About:</u></strong><br/>
Display informations on <strong>Ctrl+Paint</strong> and <strong>Matt KOHR</strong>, the <strong>TeamL2D&Company</strong> and <strong>Jordan GROSS (JpotatO)</strong>, the usage of the site (and legal but in English in this case).</li><br/>
