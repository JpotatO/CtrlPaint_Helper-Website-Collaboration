<h4>Collaboration:</h4>

The main goal of this website is to help «students» following the «Ctrl+Paint Free Video Library Guides» by Matt Kohr to learn easily and have fun will learning.

Our main objective is:

1.All users need to comprehend the subjects, in this case we need a multi-language system for both our «Website Helper» and for the Original Video Guides.

2.The users need to have more interest, more fun, and more help.

<h5>WE NEED YOUR HELP:</h5>

There is a very large quantity of information available, Matt Kohr created a quick and full learning course to learn drawing, painting, and digital arts.

 <strong>- We need you for:</strong>

× Convert to text the Voice of Matt Kohr from the Free Videos Guides using Audio-Transcription.

× Translate the original text content (shown below the videos), and the Speech-to-Text data.

× Share our website and http://ctrlpaint.com to help more "eventual" artists to progress, and construct a better community.

× Web Developers and Designers that can help us create a multi-lang content, the membership and point system,  the Homework system, the forums and other princpal things.

<h4>Working with GitHub:</h4>

We created a precise management of files and folders on GitHUb, for Example a root folder containing all translation for the Videos Subtitles, the Video Text Content, the Website Helper… .

It's the simpler way to manage this large quantity of files and data.

What you can do or not:
- You can't rename the folders and files except the «Root Translation Folder» (ie: English (Original)).
+ Instead you can add the translated name of the Files in the actual file header.

<h4>Working with Audio Transcription:</h4>

Before starting to translate anything we need to «Convert» the voice to text, this method is called Audio-Transcription and there is some tools available.

Before selecting the needed softwares we tested them strictly:

1.Need to support a lot of formats

2.Need to support customizable Keyboard shortcuts

3.Easy control of the time, speed, repetition, delay, and timestamp (it's what help us set the start and end time of a speech part), and visualisation of the audio band (if you know Audacity, it's comparable).

4.Need to be free, lightweight and multi-platform if possible.

At this moment we selected TranscribeAG to create the Timestamps and assign the voice parts.

The only issue is that we can only set the start time, then we need a better software to do this.

In this case Transcribe AG will be used to set the times of speech passages, and we will use another tool to correctly set the Timestamps for start and end.

*Manual Transcription is a Hard work, and long too, but for now we don't have a perfect (and free) way of doing this programmaticaly.

<h4>Creating the Subtitles:</h4>

Now that we have our Voice on Text with start times of the voice passages, we can assign theses passages to the video.

We use AHD Subtitles Maker Professional, and it's a free tool too, the best is that we can create a start time for a speech passage, and modify the total lenght of time, move this time to another moment of the video, add Marks and other great features.

This tool have an integrated subtitle converter, it can download subtiles from a Open Source website, and have interesting features.

The issue is the management of hotkeys, the software take more priority than the other windows shortcuts when launched, then don't use the same shortcuts in AHD Subtitles Maker Pro and in Perfect Hotkey or Clavier+ for example.
