00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.927
Hey guys this is Matt Kohr and welcome to ctrlpaint.com 

2
00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:09.996
digital painting is a lot to learn, and as a result there's a lot of videos on the site

3
00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:14.626
but I want !???! over the structure so you can understand
how the site is intended to be used

4
00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:19.788
and the first thing is it !this isn't all kyves! more so than a chanel of videos

5
00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.477
you will see that on !thursdays! I release some new free videos every week,
and that's great

6
00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:30.569
but really if you just new to the site, what you gonna wanna do is go to the library

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.096
and in the library here there is a long list of videos,
each of theses links goes from 5 minute's free video

8
00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:39.894
but before any of that we gonna do a couple of quick things

9
00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:47.016
first there are the quick themes, this !what I! call "Let's Paint",
and in theses videos I !distacles! a single object,

10
00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:51.189
and I give you a quick overview of what digital painting even looks like.

11
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.325
I don't want any details it just gives you some of what you expect down the road

12
00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:01.305
now if you watchs this videos and you still like digital painting,
it's still seems like sometime you wanna do.

13
00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:02.777
all right let's proceed

14
00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:04.057
the next thing

15
00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:07.193
is to check-out the digital painting !one on one! series

16
00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:12.024
now each of theses gives in more details in a slightly longer video

17
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:14.297
!that some of bright stand a tools!

18
00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:17.193
that we will be using !at run! digital painting

19
00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:20.048
want's you watch theses five videos if you still like digital painting

20
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.473
well, awesome, then we will proceed

21
00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:24.297
the next step gives you !??! two options

22
00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:26.187
you either go to the store

23
00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:29.810
where you go look at individual !tap ext! that are over more in-depth

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.496
this is the really delicate learning

25
00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:36.656
or like a lot of peaople go you gonna start here with theses free videos in the library

26
00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:38.888
now i've put them in an intentional order

27
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.704
and the order goes just down this list

28
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.908
but first I have one question

29
00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.256
and the question is how's your traditional experience,
you have a lot? or none at all?

30
00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:53.800
if you don't have any you really gonna learn to before you start photoshop

31
00:01:53.801 --> 00:02:00.904
and for you I've made this top section of videos, we talk about things like
drawing in composition, really basic fundation stuff

32
00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:04.552
now if you're not a beginner, if you already have that fundations

33
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:08.328
then we talk about the more digital tools lower on the page

34
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:15.140
everything below this line is all about photoshop and other digital tools,
to approach painting in a new way

35
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.111
at the very bottom of the site here

36
00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:24.000
there are videos about !fiery! and mindset, and let's !face a pin! others sweet talk challenges like

37
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.542
getting !burnt outs, stigging speared!

38
00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:34.702
having confindence of use, these are real things,
so at the bottom here theses videos don't talk all painting's techniques so much

39
00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:39.734
!???! just talk about how to live happily as an artist

40
00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:46.350
and finally I wanna mention that, I made theses videos in a different order originaly,
this is been going on for a number's views now

41
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:53.390
over the process I can of improve my system, so watch them in the order that I suggested
here going straight down at least

42
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.910
you will occasinally !in come! a moment !???! things is like

43
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:02.286
in last weeks video we talk about... !bla,bla,bla!, and you've never !actionaly heard! that video before

44
00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:03.246
don't worry

45
00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:09.198
the new order is the correct order it is has a few awkward moments !???! the videos

46
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.590
so trust me on this the old way is worst, the new way is better

47
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.726
and if you just follow this true, you're gonna have a good time

48
00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:19.914
so I wish you good luck, have fun digital painting, and thanks for coming on the site
