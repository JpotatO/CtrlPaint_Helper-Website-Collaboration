In this second part of our werewolf drawing it's time to get detailed.  With the 'manequin' drawing complete, I am able to confidently add in the specific costume and facial details that bring a drawing to life.  (Note that the werewolf character is property of Blizzard entertainment, this is a fan-art drawing.)

Make sure to catch the other parts of the constructive form miniseries!
