1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.777
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:09.600
your setting a new computer

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.124
and browsing a website that's all about digital painting

4
00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.795
so what we do with into the buisness anyway

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.480
before we dig too deep into this series of basic drawing videos 

6
00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:23.491
it's important to understand the point of it all

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.019
In this video I am gonna argue you for the importance of traditional drawing background

8
00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:30.954
and why in the long run

9
00:00:30.955 --> 00:00:34.560
this is gonna be what help's you draw space marines and dragons

10
00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:38.240
drawing is your !buildy depose! capture what you see

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.108
and invent things that you never seen

12
00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:45.751
and what's want you got to draw -a place- you can then use photoshop to refine it

13
00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:47.772
and then turning it into painting

14
00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.764
I wanna go over the general flow of this ControlPaint unplugged

15
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.097
it's gona be a long run series

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.665
and it's gona be can by any do thing the basic materials involved

17
00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.427
everything your using here is gonna be simple and cheap

18
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.160
but in every !???? on hand! repetition and practice, simple homework

19
00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.870
the next phase is gonna get in the observational drawing

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.199
the idea here's is to look at something !in your view!

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.010
or to look at something on a photo

22
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.560
and then draw it down on your paper

23
00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:24.565
!beware! reproduce objects still looking at is hard to do

24
00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.594
and it's necessary for the final phase

25
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.220
imagine the objects

26
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:33.843
in all likely !hood ??????! this is what you've been looking for to the most

27
00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:35.908
inventing stuff

28
00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:41.050
drawing from you're imagination leave it just thoses observational drawing skills

29
00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:44.877
and let's you visualize all theses cool shapes that you've got in your head

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060
put it right down on your paper

31
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.815
because the core illustration in concept art

32
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.802
is imagining a space, laying characters, and putting all together into your own composition

33
00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:04.447
as result this sort of imaginary drawing !recreate! the mastery of thoses building blocks

34
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.795
theses simple elements of observational drawing 

35
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.680
so who work on those first

36
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:14.480
I am not gona tell you that every step along this process is fun

37
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:21.165
it is hard work, sometimes is boring work, and definitely a lot of work

38
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.360
but there is no alternatives

39
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:28.681
if your goal is to make great digital paintings, then you need to master basic drawing first

40
00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:32.379
I am gona release theses videos over the coming months,

41
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.324
with still the regular Control Paint content

42
00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:36.655
so sharpen your pencils

43
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.270
and get ready to progress from basic materials

44
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.915
observational drawing, and ultimately into imaginary drawing

45
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920
thanks for watching and stay tuned.

﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

The Ctrl+Paint unplugged series is here to help you improve your basic drawing skills, and this video will show you what to expect in upcoming entries. Basic drawing doesn't seem as exciting as digital painting, so it's often skipped by beginners. Don't make this mistake!
