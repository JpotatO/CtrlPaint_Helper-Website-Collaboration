1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:07,380
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,999
So in our previous video we got
in the dust of the HB pencil

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,145
and as I said this is the most
basic tool you'll use

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,978
so for today's video

5
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:21,007
I am gonna talk about…
this,… some other pencils

6
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:25,000
and what erasers you're gona
be using for basic drawing

7
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:29,847
you've got a pencil but
what about your eraser

8
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:34,000
when I come to hard materials there some
different type of erasers

9
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,799
I just follow pick one's that you
use to at the end of your pencil

10
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:39,771
first there's a needed eraser

11
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,473
and this is like a
little ball of !puddy!

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,620
that you can do
soft erasing with it

13
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:49,606
it's great for removing gentle,

14
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,031
graphite marks that you've made
with the side of your pencil

15
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,642
because we draw with
the side of the pencil

16
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,637
you're only lyind down graphite
at the top of the paper

17
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,716
you're not carving in deep

18
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:02,960
and so a needed eraser
good at lifting this

19
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,504
soft mark making
above your paper

20
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:11,002
the second type of eraser that you
should probably have with you

21
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,801
is called vynil eraser

22
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:16,715
it is more what you use too
from the back of your pencil

23
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:22,003
this is a harder eraser that take more
of the graphite off the paper at time

24
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:25,007
this is for getting
removal's really dark marks

25
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:28,007
as a result it's less sensitive

26
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:34,002
so this may be the only way that you can
erase a line you draw with too much formes

27
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:38,310
 if you dig  into the paper too dip, a
vynil eraser might be your only chance

28
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:43,636
so I like to pair up the needed
eraser with the soft side

29
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:48,106
and a vynil eraser with a
more agressive mark making

30
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,995
those that I've done with
my tip of the pencil

31
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,627
they're both useful, and as
you get used to moving it more

32
00:01:56,652 --> 00:01:59,389
you'll understand when
each one is more appropriated

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,336
now I'm sure you
expected the HB pencil

34
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:07,598
but what you may not have
expected is the color pencil

35
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,632
and this not commonly necessary to hide
that you've used color pencils in the past

36
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:17,519
but still I like to use color pencils
as a way of drawing my foundations

37
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,006
drawing my sketch

38
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,521
and there is a couple
of reason to this

39
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:23,857
first off you have a
a color pencil

40
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:27,042
is a bit wax here, that you
have with a graphite pencil

41
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,658
so what is mine is to have
a soft feel on the paper

42
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,511
and especially that the door

43
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:35,313
it'll… little very flood the line work

44
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,726
it doesn't provide
much resistance

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,225
because it's so glassy

46
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:42,826
the second good thing

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,540
is that you can separate

48
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:45,757
 your fondation

49
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,257
from your final drawing

50
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,584
with the color

51
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,587
so if you wanna use

52
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,666
a non-photo blue

53
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,965
color pencil, wich his
this picture here

54
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,251
if you want to drawer into drawn

55
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:01,073
 and !impuding! a graphite
pencil drawing on top

56
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:02,934
you can take that

57
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,807
putting it in the !wax! machine

58
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:06,795
and the final result

59
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,113
will completely

60
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,847
erase all of the blue

61
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,165
and all you're left with,
is the final pencil drawing

62
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:16,201
I understand, not many
of you have access too

63
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:17,320
the !wax (lol)! machine

64
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,854
nobody have thoses at home

65
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,599
but in photoshop

66
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:22,333
you can take the same soul of

67
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,646
color… and graphite drawing

68
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,266
and when you scan it

69
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:29,507
you manipulate the blue to
make it much less profond

70
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:32,126
so this free's you up to make

71
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,221
really flowly gestual

72
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,562
exploration sketches
with the color pencil

73
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,963
and then when you
find's a line you like

74
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:41,959
you can got a sharp
graphite pencil

75
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,403
to put down your… final lines

76
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,037
your homework for
this week is simple

77
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,723
remember when we did
visual measuring

78
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:52,869
and drew cellphones

79
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,988
it's gonna be the same
homework as in it

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
only this time

81
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:57,761
you gonna do it first

82
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,177
with the blue pencil

83
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,804
really any color pencil will do

84
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,544
I does like to make blue lines

85
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:07,947
using a color pencil first
release you to use the eraser

86
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:10,182
and you come with a
more accurate drawing

87
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,436
before you do the second path

88
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,971
with your HB pencil

89
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,987
and now so be when
you're putting here

90
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,289
more defined

91
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,069
fine edge lines

92
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:21,215
so you have the rough sketch

93
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,528
followed by the control drawing

94
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,743
so get used to drawn with the cup
different types of pencils

95
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:28,937
try out that needed eraser

96
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,246
and have fun with this

97
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:31,476
goog luck guys : )

﻿<br/><h2>2.Video Content</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

Basic drawing doesn't need to involve many tools, but the two described in this video are essential: pencils and erasers. Here you'll find a basic introduction to the types of pencils and erasers commonly used in drawing. Additionally, I explain how colored pencils (including non-photo blue) can be used in a line-drawing to construct form. The lesson ends with a quick homework assignment to test out your new knowledge!
