00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:07.004
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.999
So in our previous video we got to the dust of the HB pencil

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.004
as I said this is the most basic tool you'll use

4
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.000
so for today's video

5
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.007
I am gona take about, this, some other pencils

6
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.000
and what erasers you're gona be using for basic drawing

7
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.001
you've got a pencil but what about your eraser

8
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.000
!when I come to hard's! materials !of some! different type of erasers

9
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.999
I just follow pick one's that you use to at the end of your pencil

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
first there's a needed eraser

11
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.003
and this is like a little ball of !pudding!

12
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.002
that you can do soft erasing with

13
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.004
it's great for removing gentle,

14
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:53.000
graphite marks that you've made with the side of your pencil

15
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.000
because we draw with the side of the pencil

16
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.003
you're only lyind down graphite at the top of the paper

17
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.005
you're not carving in deep

18
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:03.001
and so a needed eraser good at lifting this

19
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.000
soft mark making above your paper

20
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.002
the second type of eraser that you should probably have with you

21
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.000
is called vynil eraser

22
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:17.005
it is more what you use too from the back of your pencil

23
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:22.003
this is a harder eraser that take more of graphite off the paper !a time!

24
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.007
this is for getting removal's really dark marks

25
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.007
as a result it's less sensitive

26
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.002
so this may be the only way that you can erase a line you draw with too much !???!

27
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:39.000
if you !dogue! into the paper too dip, a vynil eraser might be your only chance

28
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:44.007
so I like to pair up the needed eraser with the soft side

29
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:49.000
and a vynil eraser with a more agressive mark making

30
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.960
those that I've do with my tip of the pencil

31
00:01:53.004 --> 00:02:00.000
they're both useful, and as you get used to !moving! it more you'll understand
 when each one is more appropriated

32
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.000
now I'm sure you expected the HB pencil

33
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.007
but what you may not have expected is the color pencil

34
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:13.004
and this not !commonly necessary for hide you've used! color pencils in the past

35
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:17.999
but still I like to use color pencils as a way of drawing my foundations

36
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.006
drawing my sketch

﻿<br/><h2>2.Video Content</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

Basic drawing doesn't need to involve many tools, but the two described in this video are essential: pencils and erasers. Here you'll find a basic introduction to the types of pencils and erasers commonly used in drawing. Additionally, I explain how colored pencils (including non-photo blue) can be used in a line-drawing to construct form. The lesson ends with a quick homework assignment to test out your new knowledge!
