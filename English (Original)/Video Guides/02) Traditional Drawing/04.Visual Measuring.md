00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:06,463
~Opening Theme ~

2
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:08,965
when come's to good
observational drawing

3
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:12,413
I'd say it's more
observation, and less drawing

4
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:15,432
so I drew this line right here

5
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,582
and ask you what angle is that

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,786
you probably couldn't tell me

7
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:22,175
because you're missing one
important piece of information

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,455
and that is

9
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,685
either Horizontal or Vertical

10
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,482
to measure a real !tip to!

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,068
so now you can say,
that this is a

12
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,134
40% angle

13
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:32,424
something like that

14
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:35,662
you probably don't even realise

15
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,510
how often you're
looking at an angle

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,159
and visualy measuring it

17
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:41,429
so let's say this
is my paper here

18
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:43,588
and I got a !so fun! on
the table in front of me

19
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,248
I gota draw

20
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,796
some rectangular shape

21
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,720
that's the first line I draw

22
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,344
oh, and I'm gonna base

23
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:55,266
other rest of the lines,
off of that initial line

24
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,356
so maybe it's some of a
rectangular form like this

25
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,082
what is very possible

26
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,553
that this initial line here

27
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:04,364
this angle

28
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:05,324
is wrong

29
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:07,860
!???! trying draw again

30
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:09,815
I may be look more carefuly

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,933
and see the actualy

32
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,386
there is a bit !Shower!
of an angle

33
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,708
where tip to the
edge of the paper

34
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,790
and so in this case

35
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:19,647
all the rest of my lines
will be different

36
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:21,922
and my result in !???!
just gonna be

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,108
quit a bit remove
from that first try

38
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,293
so with this can down to

39
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:29,382
is…one…

40
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:30,803
incorrect measurement

41
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,242
this first angle here

42
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:33,879
being quit a bit different here

43
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,755
and then the rest of my drawing

44
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,027
his a series of
!repelling the stakes!

45
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:41,886
or, starting from that
first bad measurement

46
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:44,128
so we can create that…

47
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:46,504
visual measuring is
incredibely important

48
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,102
what had you do it
had you, avoid this

49
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,535
and have a better shade,
measuring quickly the first time

50
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:55,252
turns out

51
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,284
your pencil, can do it for you

52
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:02,147
here's a quick diagram for
what wich I've been doing

53
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,984
take your pencil in your hand

54
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:05,421
extend your arm

55
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,333
all the way, locking
your eyebrow

56
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,392
and then

57
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,800
make a vertical line, in the air

58
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:11,562
with your pencil

59
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,408
when you then does
look past the pencil

60
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,869
and you subject

61
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,626
that you have something
to compare the angle to

62
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:23,090
maybe if what you !???!
measuring the holes on a angle

63
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,862
or then you turn you pencil, 90°

64
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,461
keeping your eyebrow locked

65
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:28,691
and then you have

66
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,455
a horizontal line to compare to

67
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,635
so you're holding
your pencil verticaly

68
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,248
you're looking past it

69
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:37,772
and you see the subject

70
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,379
so now if I wanna draw

71
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,557
this top angle of the phone

72
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:46,409
I have something to compare to

73
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:48,840
that vertical edge of my paper

74
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,396
is exactly the same
as that pencil

75
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,346
so I know that the top
edge of that phone

76
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,848
has to match

77
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:58,558
see here

78
00:02:58,597 --> 00:02:59,366
that's parallel

79
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,678
and once I got one
angle in place,

80
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:05,133
I much more likely to
get the rest correct

81
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,718
now I turn my pencil sideways

82
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,988
and at this pont, much
easier to mesure that…

83
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,444
bottom angle of the box

84
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,114
so it's gonna be

85
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,005
a bit like this

86
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:25,280
and I know that the other
id briefely paralel to that

87
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,568
and in this way I can start to

88
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,560
mass out…

89
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:31,412
the shape

90
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,872
carefuly measuring
these first angles

91
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,647
and I can probably
gess that this

92
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,777
vertical here are… pretty
close to actualy vertical

93
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,566
so that be a bit paralel
to the edge of my paper

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,722
and in this way

95
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,428
I come to much more
accurate drawing

96
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,585
but if something's
looking not quite right

97
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,183
you've got your pencil

98
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:57,471
you've got the subject
in front of you

99
00:03:57,868 --> 00:03:59,431
and you can compare the angles

100
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,443
so if now !is know the things!
for instance

101
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,298
but the bottom angle

102
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,075
of my drawing is wrong

103
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:09,809
something just wasn't seem in
quite right about my image

104
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,193
and then I hold up my pencil

105
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:15,728
look at the subject's angle

106
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,699
and I correct my
drawing accordingely

107
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:28,885
you're homewortk this time
is deceptively simple

108
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:30,473
what you gonna do

109
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,555
is draw 20 phones

110
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:33,641
or really

111
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,626
any rectangular present will do

112
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,078
for me I have an
old blacky phone

113
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:38,578
so

114
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:39,633
it's very handy

115
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,437
and what you gonna draw these on

116
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,900
is a 2×3 inche format

117
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:46,997
so that mind you gonna do whore

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,042
you're mark of

119
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,447
a bunch of theses little

120
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,201
2×3 inche rectangles

121
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:52,284
and then…

122
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,712
trying feels much over this
you can with the phone

123
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:57,585
and what I do is
to give you a nice

124
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,228
verticals and horizontals

125
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,188
to judge your, angles against

126
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:04,244
these are not mean
to be drawn quickly

127
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
you're defenitely
not doing details

128
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:08,142
the important thing

129
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,793
is to get used to looking

130
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,753
carefuly… at an object

131
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,788
and seeing thoses
angles accurately

132
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,639
you may be thinking

133
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,033
how absurde I'd like
to measuring angles

134
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,366
but that boring subject matters

135
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:21,974
!who buts the point!

136
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:25,478
this is gonna be extremely !???!
if you got it right

137
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,152
and very !???! if
you get it wrong

138
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,787
there is not much
complexity in this subject

139
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,574
and for thoses that are out
here watching theses videos

140
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,344
kick in your fit back and same

141
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,510
oh I got this

142
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,167
I did this years ago

143
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:39,397
do it again

144
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,302
this is one of the
things that our do

145
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,580
evry couple months

146
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:45,964
and, every time I do worst
that I thin I'm gonna do

147
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,480
measuring needs an angles

148
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:49,952
and observe that object

149
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,302
very simple

150
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,087
is a lot harder than you think

151
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,592
so great find the practice

152
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:56,473
so

153
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,504
give it a go

154
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:58,603
20 Phones

Drawing is at least 50% 'seeing'. In order to capture the subject that you're looking at, you need to be able to critically look at it. One of the methods that artists use to accurately observe an object is called "visual measuring", and it's described in this video.
