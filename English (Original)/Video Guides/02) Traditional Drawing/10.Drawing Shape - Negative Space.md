Sometimes the best way to see an object is by looking at the space surrounding it. No, this is not abstract zen wisdom - it is called "negative space". Learning to see negative space is just as important as the subject itself (the positive space). Eventually, when you're designing characters and environments, you'll be using the negative space intentionally - so get used to looking for it in your still life drawings!
