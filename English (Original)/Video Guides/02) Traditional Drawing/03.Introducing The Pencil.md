1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:07,379
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:11,228
there lines like the
ones at the left

3
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:12,545
and the ones at the right

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,243
I did a bunch of

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,079
short hairy strokes

6
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:16,849
or so to…

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,982
clamp together trying to
prettend one big stroke

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,379
this is probably because you're

9
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:24,340
gripping your pencil
the wrong way

10
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:28,468
what is the first thing you remember
being talk to do with the pencil?

11
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:32,603
my guess is that we use to write our
name when we are in great school

12
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,649
in this video I'm
gonna reintroduce you

13
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:38,109
to the most basic
drawing tool there is

14
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:39,669
the N°2 pencil

15
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,919
when it goes to pencils

16
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,983
almost exclusively for writing

17
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:47,836
and then we use to learn
to use them the wrong way

18
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:49,606
with the tight grip

19
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,296
and because later on
small and closy grip

20
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,018
the way that we hold the pencil

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,225
is designed to limit
your range of motion

22
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,849
and drawing is the
exact opposite

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,812
a good idea is to have

24
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,709
a range of mark making

25
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:06,975
maybe when we doing some
small controled strokes

26
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,811
!the ben! or so large
smoothing gestures

27
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:13,227
and for this you need a
unrestricted posture

28
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,985
in fact you want the easyest
to improve your confidence

29
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:18,964
to have a better line work

30
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:20,831
it's to do what's called

31
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,601
«drawing from the shoulder»

32
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:25,201
so what I mean to «draw
from the shoulder»

33
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,918
our !mising! about
primarily bending

34
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,148
your eyebrow

35
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:30,053
and your shoulder

36
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,867
not your finger tips

37
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,755
and definitely not your wrist

38
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:39,612
but this changes may require you to rearrange
your desk or to stand when you draw

39
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,786
but it can automaticaly change the way
you're able to make your line marks

40
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,651
so when you hold the
pencil in this way

41
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,575
try using… the side
of the graphite

42
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,532
to lay down… some soft lines

43
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,564
and make sure that you're
pencil is down to start line

44
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,985
the idea's here is
to make, quick,

45
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,652
flood marks, with the
side of your pencil

46
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,989
drawing with the tip
of a sharpened pencil

47
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,366
is like carving into the surface
of the paper !that you chose it!

48
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:11,369
it's a very !slawn fadicle!
thing

49
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,278
you will do the same of
the top drawing in future

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,469
but for now

51
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,289
the focus is on loose

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,670
gesture sketching

53
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,577
using the side of your pencil

54
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,049
so let's talk about, the
pencil it's so !freat!

55
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,175
first off you know this that to the end
of this !lesson! about with !???! reading

56
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:33,599
and what is your first tool is the
type of the graphite that it contains

57
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,341
now what I like is to want
to start right in the center

58
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,507
with HB

59
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:40,773
this is all so know as
N°2 pencil, in america

60
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:43,999
now if you have a… 4B

61
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:45,652
what you have is a much

62
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:46,906
darker line

63
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,343
and this is gonna be
almost like charcoal

64
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:51,388
with the softer marks

65
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,494
it tend to smudge a little more

66
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,108
and it lives some
of the dark to dark

67
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,119
the other end of this
fact fact form is an in H's

68
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:00,588
that goes 6H

69
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,865
will be a very hard graphite

70
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,568
so this can be
sharpened very sharp

71
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:08,048
and creates very delicates marks

72
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,707
for your light line !copy!

73
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,060
so when I go about this

74
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,655
I line up to the store

75
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,905
about the whole range,
of my !father work!

76
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,968
I get a !new line!

77
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:19,878
turns out… that is tool one

78
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,714
there is a big way's to make

79
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:23,968
is specialy immediately
starting out

80
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,170
you really can do fine with

81
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,376
one pencil

82
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,142
now I like to use, an HB

83
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:33,035
right in center, it's
got a fine range

84
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,976
it's good to know the differences between
them all, if you're preference may be

85
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,055
a 2B or something like that

86
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:41,520
but you really don't
need all the pencils

87
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,992
and you probably know this

88
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:47,334
that the others drawing pencil
does not have an eraser

89
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,830
it's only painted
wood at the end

90
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:51,561
to believing on it

91
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,753
this can be a big relieve

92
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:54,867
to separate pencil from eraser

93
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,155
and the fact to,
for nice homework

94
00:03:57,393 --> 00:04:00,247
you're not gonna be concerning
with, making the perfect mark

95
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,192
and !proceding! is not
important at all for !demand!

96
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,778
as a result… you can't mess up

97
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:07,293
so you don't need an eraser

98
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,908
your homework tonight,
is to feel five

99
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,197
scrap papers, with ovals

100
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,708
any type of paper will do, be
it doesn't need to be nice

101
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,494
then begin drawing
from the shoulder

102
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
and once again

103
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,005
that minds in your
finger tips are rest

104
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:24,549
they won't be bending at all

105
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:28,418
your shoulder, and eyebrow,
!all you made other work!

106
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,786
and the goal is to

107
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,900
begin to feel what it's
like to while the pencil

108
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,241
new sketching

109
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:36,720
not type !processing!

110
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,773
and I know this may
seem like !doloring!

111
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,137
boringly pointless

112
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,550
but remember

113
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,340
you have used an experience

114
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:45,443
holding the pencil

115
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:47,014
for writing

116
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,617
in a tight write grip

117
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,467
to text him too

118
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,606
retrain your muscles
in your brain

119
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:53,662
for the new posture

120
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,759
you're not setting
up to make the whole

121
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,673
most beautyful perfect ovals

122
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:00,581
all you're doing

123
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,501
is getting a little
pencil line edge

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,879
you're just taking
the first steps

125
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:06,657
to a confident drawing

126
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:08,837
so turn on some good music

127
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,901
and spend a while drawing ovals

128
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,552
and draw from the shoulder

129
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:14,610
thanks for watching

130
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:15,698
and have fun with this ; )
