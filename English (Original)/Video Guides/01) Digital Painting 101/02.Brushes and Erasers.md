00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.477
~Opening Theme~ 

2
00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:13.058
in the first video in this serie, I've shown you the very
basics of getting around photoshop 

3
00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.277
at this point you probably !champling at the bit!
actively start painting things 

4
00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:20.823
so this video is gonna be all about brushes, and erasers

5
00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:25.097
so view our settings out to find, proper tools to draw with photoshop 

6
00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:28.067
you probably first look at the toolbar 

7
00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:29.219
and you know the step 

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.463
you've got a brush tool 

9
00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.785
pencil tool 

10
00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.421
further down you've got a pen tool 

11
00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:39.340
there is a paint bucket 

12
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:43.120
overally I think they look like traditional paint tools 

13
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.028
if you're a traditional painter 

14
00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:46.900
but you may not !somebody who drawn! 

15
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.322
where is the airbrush tool? 

16
00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:49.456
where is the markers? 

17
00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:51.119
about form pens 

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.121
the truth is 

19
00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.511
you'll be using a single, tool, witch photoshop color's the brush tool 

20
00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:59.507
to be mimicking all of theses traditional media

21
00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:02.517
so let's still look at somebody brush in action 

22
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.502
now you know the !song! switching between brushes 

23
00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:15.978
and all I am doing 

24
00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.444
is opening at the !side! menu 

25
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.038
and changing the brush head 

26
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.144
so to do that 

27
00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:29.120
select the brush tool on the toolbar 

28
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.144
and then right click 

29
00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:33.674
and a secret menu appears 

30
00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:41.810
among that, is a list of your custom brushes 

31
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.003
!see can see these really quider range! 

32
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.333
and imagination is, you're only limitation when it comes to theses 

33
00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:52.967
different types of brushes 

34
00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:56.501
and !they are! contain what photoshop calls, the brush tool

35
00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:58.715
even if you're doing things it'll look kind of like 

36
00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.245
a pencil or a pen 

37
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.134
but still are, the brush tool 

38
00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:09.181
so with all theses choices in front of you,
you've got everything you'll ever need to paint with, right? 

39
00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.026
I'de suggest you may actualy have too much 

40
00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:12.088
specialy for starting on 

41
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:17.857
when it comes to my paintings, about 90% of the time,
I am really only using few brushes 

42
00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:21.007
even I've got four or fifthies that I use occasionaly

43
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.455
generaly !speaking! a couple of versatile brushes 

44
00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:25.651
it's really what's you need for most of your works 

45
00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:32.008
so let me hide this here and show you the proper
three brushes I like to start with

46
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.610
there is the hard round 

47
00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:39.262
the soft round 

48
00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.204
this one is more like an airbrush 

49
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.148
and a hard flat 

50
00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:51.516
in if you really want theses brushes, I wanna take a step further 

51
00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:53.028
you can go to my site 

52
00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.666
http: //ctrlpaint.com 

53
00:02:54.667 --> 00:03:00.002
and in the free download section, I've provided a file that
contains only theses three brushes 

54
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.576
!so what to do with it! override 

55
00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:07.350
others default brushes, and give you a nice clean, for your brush 

56
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:10.428
now of course you can bring back theses defaults at any time 

57
00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:17.119
but it's really nice to have, only the three !chose forms!,
to really, keep that palette clean 

58
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.123
so in the last video !I decide to! the idea of navigation
on keyboard shortcuts 

59
00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:30.292
other brush tool, unsurprisingly has some handfull of
incredibely important keyboard shortcuts 

60
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:39.267
so you gonna be using both your navigation, and your
brush keyboard shortcut, simultaneously, to really save a lot of time 

61
00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:44.436
so now I am gonna go over each of the keyboard shortcuts
that the brush tool use 

62
00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:46.893
first stuff, to change the master diameter 

63
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:56.553
you gonna use the bracket keys witch can be found next to P
on your keyboard (Attention: QWERTY Keyboards only) 

64
00:03:56.554 --> 00:04:00.558
to change the color of your brush, if you don't wanna
open the color picker window 

65
00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:01.611
all you have to do 

66
00:04:01.612 --> 00:04:03.447
is just hold down the alt key 

67
00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:05.202
!and! change I can 

68
00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.894
into an eyedropper 

69
00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.041
to pickup any color that's already down on your canvas 

70
00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.687
this is incredibely useful, and 

71
00:04:12.688 --> 00:04:15.931
the next video is gonna be devoted primarily to this concept 

72
00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:16.408
so 

73
00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.010
I keep it brief for now 

74
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:21.485
if you wanna draw a straight line 

75
00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:22.716
you hold down 

76
00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:23.760
shift 

77
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:24.762
and the !???! 

78
00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:28.104
lock at horizontal or vertical 

79
00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:30.088
now, say you want to draw a straight line that is 

80
00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:32.203
on a arbitrary axis 

81
00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:33.535
to do that 

82
00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:34.950
it's a little more complicated 

83
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:36.453
the true step process 

84
00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:37.505
first you click 

85
00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:38.507
once 

86
00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:41.870
to the terminus start point 

87
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.054
now you hold down, shift 

88
00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:49.096
you click a second time, to determine the end point 

89
00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:55.987
so it's click, shift+click 

90
00:04:55.988 --> 00:05:00.006
now you know some of the keyboard shortcuts
I'm telling you are the PC shortcuts 

91
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.038
if you want to find the MAC keyboard shortcuts there a, handy 

92
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:13.576
PDF !stuff!, Adobe provide, on their website 

93
00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:19.890
I may wonder how it is that we've gotten so far into video
that's all about brushes, and erasers 

94
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:22.455
and that I've never mentionned the eraser tool once 

95
00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:23.841
there is a reason for that 

96
00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:26.553
see in photoshop, the, eraser tool 

97
00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:28.592
is exactly the same as the brush tool 

98
00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:30.992
except for one key distinction 

99
00:05:30.993 --> 00:05:33.407
the brush tool, add's pigments to the canvas 

100
00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:35.960
the eraser tool remove's pigments 

101
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.150
there are not, but share alike in common 

102
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:41.626
for example all of the keyboard shortcuts, you got about the brush tool 

103
00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:44.558
will work with the eraser's as well 

104
00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.291
the eraser share, a brush library between the brush
and the eraser 

105
00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:50.683
so when you use 

106
00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.302
the eraser tool, select the !final! tool panel 

107
00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:56.007
to erase theses three squares in the blue 

108
00:05:56.008 --> 00:06:01.910
I begin with the hard round eraser 

109
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.080
now right click and switch to the 

110
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.885
soft round 

111
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:08.702
and this is maybe more alike using 

112
00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:13.323
a needed eraser if you are drawing with traditional media 

113
00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:14.952
and finaly I try the 

114
00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:17.103
hard flat 

115
00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:20.180
this is, all about more alike using a vynil eraser 

116
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:26.097
if you really want a curved hard edge 

117
00:06:26.098 --> 00:06:27.753
when you watch the first video 

118
00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.984
you know it, and with the simple worksheet

119
00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:33.566
that help reinforce the concept that we ran over in that lesson

120
00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:35.034
I'm gonna do something here 

121
00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:38.924
and this time begining working on, brush technique 

122
00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:41.822
and it's gonna be important to use keyboard shortcuts for this 

123
00:06:41.823 --> 00:06:45.211
because that's the whole idea of that lesson 

124
00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:46.714
so I show you the first example 

125
00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:48.964
using the hard round brush 

126
00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:51.680
I begin simply from a blue color provided 

127
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.931
and begin by drawing vertical lines 

128
00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:59.334
each one is gonna be increasingly wide 

129
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:03.366
and I'm using the shift key, to snap verticaly 

130
00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:11.645
and do that something like horizontal lines 

131
00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:14.760
and now I'm gonna try curves, !on my draw! 

132
00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:15.762
from 

133
00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:17.999
left to right in a bit light 

134
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.874
to dark 

135
00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:30.193
I'm do something well along the !firster! 

136
00:07:30.194 --> 00:07:32.101
and finaly I'm gonna use the 

137
00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:34.757
click, shift+click 

138
00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:35.990
to draw 

139
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:38.060
rectangle 

140
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:43.647
and then cross it into the center 

141
00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:45.807
and now I'm gonna had complete with the same worksheet

142
00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:47.022
using the other tool 

143
00:07:47.023 --> 00:07:49.020
the basic three brushes 

144
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:53.765
soft round 

145
00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:56.390
and a hard flat 

146
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:58.964
and you probably know this is not a pretty worksheet 

147
00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:01.304
the goal's not to make a perfectly !opice! here 

148
00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:03.943
but really this is a great way to get used to the idea 

149
00:08:03.944 --> 00:08:05.284
of using thoses brushes 

150
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:09.210
and learn the keyboard shortcuts to change the properties

Part 2: Brushes

Welcome to part two of the digital painting 101 series. In today’s short less we’re going to dig into the meat of photoshop painting: the brush and eraser tools.
One tool, many forms
[brush_types.png]

You might notice that the tool palette contains both a Pencil and a Brush tool. This seems like a reasonable distinction – after all, traditional painters have brushes, pencils, airbrushes, pens, and more. So where are the buttons for airbrushes? Spray paint? Markers? The answer is found in a single tool: the Brush tool. This single tool can take nearly any form – ranging from pens and pencils all the way to watercolor and rubber stamps. For your purposes the brush tool will be the only thing you need to add pigment to your canvas.

To change the type of brush that you’re working with simply right click anywhere on the canvas (If you’re using a Wacom tablet, the lower half of the rocker switch serves as right click. Be careful when gripping the pen – otherwise you might right click accidentially!)

When you do this a secret menu appears near your cursor. Each of these icons represents a different type of brush. You can add to this list with things called ‘custom brushes’, or make your own.

What brushes should you use?

Any artist will tell you a different answer to the question of brush choices. The best advice I can offer is to start simple. Limiting yourself to a handful of useful, versatile, brushes is the best way to approach digital painting. Even though I’ve been painting for years, the three following brushes are used for 90% of my painting.
[brush_examples.png]

Hard round – This has a circular head and a sharp edge. It’s the most useful brush in all of photoshop.

Soft round – Also circular, this brush lacks the definition of the hard round. It’s more similar to an airbrush or spray paint. It is great for painting smooth transitions and moody atmosphere.

Hard flat – This is a variation of the Hard round. It has a flattened oval head and a hard edge. This has a more directional quality to it, but has a tendency to leave nice looking brush edge marks.

Click to download basic 3.ABR brush file

Installing the ‘Basic 3′ Custom Brushes:

    Restart Photoshop
    Make a new document
    Select the Brush (B) tool, and reveal the Brush palette
    Click on the small Settings icon
    Select the “Replace brushes” option
    Locate and select the mKohr_basic3.ABR file

Congratulations! You’ve now removed some unnecessary clutter. If you want them back at any time, find the ‘reset brushes’ option on the same menu.

Brush tool, expanded

By now you’ve probably experimented with the brush tool. It makes marks pressure sensitive marks in the active (foreground) color. With a few useful keyboard shortcuts, you can have much finer control!

Changing the color: To change the color without using the color picker, just hold down the ALT key. This changes your cursor to an eye dropper and wherever you click will select a new color.

Changing the size: To change the size with keyboard shortcuts, use the bracket keys found to the right of the “P” key. “[“ makes the brush smaller, and “]” makes the brush larger.

Alternately, hold down alt+right click and drag the red preview shape to alter the size of your brush (ctrl+option+drag on mac).

Drawing along a ruler: To draw a vertical or horizontal line, first hold down the shift key. As you draw, you’ll notice that your line has a magnetic quality as if you’re drawing along a ruler.

“Pulling a straight line”: To draw a straight line at any other angle, follow these simple steps:

    Click once to define the start, then release
    While holding shift, click to define the end of the line.

The one caveat of this technique is that the line’s intensity will fade as it progresses from beginning to end. Keep in mind that the side you begin with will be darker than the ending side. If you’re interested in making technical drawings, you could create a custom brush that has no pressure sensitivity – which wold function more like an ink pen. A custom brush of this sort would not exhibit the same fading effect.
[pulling_straight_lines.jpg]

Move your current layer around: While the brush tool is active, you can hold the Ctrl key to temporarily select the Move tool. This can be handy if you want to change the placement of the layer you’re drawing on.

The Eraser Tool

With all of that brush tool information you just trudged through, do you have the stamina left to learn about the Eraser tool? I’ll let you in on a secret: you already have. The Eraser tool functions exactly the same as the brush tool – but it removes pigment instead of adding it. Everything you learned about the brush tool applies!
