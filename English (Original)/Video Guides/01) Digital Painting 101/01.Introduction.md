00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:08.000
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:13.174
My name is Matt Kohr, and I am a concept artist in the video game industry

3
00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:19.526
I've got a lot of questions about, specific !???! I go about making theses digital paintings

4
00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:23.700
or all of people seems to have in their mind that's a very confusing process

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.664
what i've gonna creating in theses online resources to hopely demistify some of theses processes

6
00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:34.764
cause the truth is, there's a lot of practice involved, because it is hard work

7
00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:40.034
but, the computer part of it, using photoshop is really !nearly! challenging

8
00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:45.750
so I've created theses videos, to describe the process that I use with photoshop

9
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.270
down in the repeatable steps

10
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.840
and even I love watching speed painting videos on youtube

11
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.528
my approach is gonna be a little different

12
00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:58.812
in !selection! you exactly how that I approach a single  illustration

13
00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:00.450
I wanna trying communicate 

14
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:06.582
the general principles that I use, so that you can then take them  and play it to every things you wanna work on 

15
00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.301
so we gonna start out slow

16
00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:12.585
and by the end of theses five videos, you'll be off and runing

17
00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.550
so now I am gonna show you the difference between

18
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.239
using a mouse to draw

19
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.297
versus using a Wacom tablet 

20
00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:27.033
so first I'm gonna draw with my mouse

21
00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:29.133
and now I'm gonna pick up my tablet

22
00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:32.439
and I'm gonna draw

23
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.497
so the couple of things you may know is

24
00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:39.537
on one hand the mouse as only a binary action, it's gonna be On  or Off

25
00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:43.444
with the stylus, you have a degradation of presure sensitivity

26
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.216
to go from light to dark

27
00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:50.542
or so my motions can be much more fluid, cause it's a lot more  like drawing with a pen

28
00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.592
than it is

29
00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:54.322
clicking with the mouse

30
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:58.186
so this is the crucial first step to get started

31
00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.908
now before with give in too dip here

32
00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.898
I'm gonna take this step bake and make a few definitions

33
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.712
so, in photoshop turns, a panel

34
00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:08.476
is not what you think of

35
00:02:08.477 --> 00:02:10.198
in the traditional painting sense

36
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.130
and still my voice say panel

37
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.242
I refer to flooding panel, of information

38
00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:19.270
when you open the window menu

39
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.530
you can hide

40
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.168
or view panels

41
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.730
so this is the layers panel

42
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:26.368
and at the bottom of the panel

43
00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.754
you can see buttons

44
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:31.492
that can create new layers and !deliver! layers

45
00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:34.810
the !volicle! panel on the left side of the screen, is see right  here

46
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.490
is called the tools panel

47
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.968
is called the tools panel

48
00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.213
and that contains things like the brush tool

49
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:42.851
the eraser tool

50
00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:46.211
and your color swatches

51
00:02:46.212 --> 00:02:49.361
and when you click a tool, like the brush tool

52
00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:52.259
the !holers on! about at the top of the screen

53
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.603
or change

54
00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:55.745
and this is called the tools proprieties

55
00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:59.147
so as you see here I've got, opacity and flow

56
00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:01.121
theses are properties of the brush tool

57
00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:07.083
if I want to change to the eraser I'd have different properties

58
00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.309
and when you got the brush tool selected

59
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.425
what of the most simple and common actions, is to change the  color on brush

60
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:17.247
so, to do that, you gonna go at the bottom of the tool panel

61
00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:22.818
and you see two squares of colors, it probably differs to black  square, and a white square

62
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.739
and when one is overlapping the other, it's called the  foreground color 

63
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.081
and from properties, the foreground color is what's on your  brush, so right now it's black

64
00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:41.565
and !??! I change it, I click on this, foreground square, and a  new window's open that the color picker

65
00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.975
so you can manipulate the color here

66
00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:47.291
chose one you like

67
00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:48.400
and click okay

68
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:53.435
and now you've got a new color on your brush

69
00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:58.139
now you're watching theses videos because you want to use  photoshop for painting

70
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.305
now the fact is, others artists use photoshop for all maners of  !properces!

71
00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:08.681
some use it for web design, others for photography, there's just  a lot to it

72
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:13.240
when I'm painting on photoshop I am only using a small fraction  of what he have to offer

73
00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:15.298
and that is are really slow me down

74
00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.322
I don't need to use all the different tools all the time

75
00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:22.732
so it's good to know, what bits of the interface you should have  on screen

76
00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:25.546
and what bits you can just hide and forget about

77
00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:28.402
the one's I like to display when working

78
00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:31.090
can all be found in the window menu

79
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.710
I like the tools

80
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.692
the layers

81
00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:39.133
and the navigator

82
00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:42.217
and now I get in the details as !witch it this! in the following  videos

83
00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:45.840
but for now, just know that this is the layer that we will using 

84
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:50.546
and this is the three important panel's to have on screen

85
00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:53.526
what of the most important parts about using computer to paint

86
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.088
is to let the software get out of the way

87
00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.860
what you wanna focus on is the fun part

88
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.422
of the illustration, what you don't want to worry about,

89
00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:03.648
is witch but !??!

90
00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.706
where this another menu's it

91
00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:08.772
so I think one of the first concept's you need to learn

92
00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:12.846
are some handy keyboard shortcuts, to navigate arround photoshop

93
00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:14.628
where is the you can !void! using

94
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.408
on screen buttons, and a !void! using menus

95
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.902
specifically the ability to zoom

96
00:05:22.903 --> 00:05:27.690
and the ability to paint

97
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.538
so if you want to zoom on your image 

98
00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.767
you could click, the !large ???! on the navigator

99
00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:36.371
or the small !???! to zoom out

100
00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:39.731
but I do give that it's better to use keyboard shortcut

101
00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:43.670
and on a Pc that's "Control+"

102
00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:49.055
and "Control-" to zoom out

103
00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:50.837
now when you zoom them

104
00:05:50.838 --> 00:05:53.018
no matter what tool you're using at the moment

105
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.911
if you hold down space bar

106
00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:53.017
you're cursor will change into a hand

107
00:05:57.018 --> 00:06:03.143
and now you have the ability to "pan" your document

108
00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:16.285
and finaly, at any time if you hit "Tab", you hide the  interface, and now you can paint full screen

109
00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:20.065
and you don't need to worry about "these" color in a pure view

110
00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:23.635
then to bring it back, hit Tab a second time

111
00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.483
and there it is

112
00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:30.103
so one more time not's, "control+" to zoom in

113
00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:32.161
"control-" to zoom out

114
00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:39.425
and space bar, to use the hand tool

115
00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:43.037
if you're new to photoshop, you've covered a lot of ground

116
00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:48.035
now I am learning new things what it's, painting or, but ever  maybe

117
00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:52.527
I like to review what I just learned, and !psifivirement!

118
00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:56.097
I don't wanna try out the new techniques on my next illustration 

119
00:06:56.098 --> 00:06:58.197
in stade this make some other workships

120
00:06:58.197 --> 00:07:01.038
and I give it a few tryies in to like you !????!

121
00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.875
some end each of theses, in lectury videos

122
00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:10.041
with a quick workship for you to do, that will help you  reinforce the techniques I've just covered

123
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:13.443
so in this case, the goal is gonna be to work with thoses

124
00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:16.920
navigation keyboard shortcuts 

125
00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:19.180
so the first step

126
00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:21.043
is to get the brush tool

127
00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:25.872
and with a color picker, pick a red color

128
00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:34.817
and in the upper-left corner of your canvas draw a triangle

129
00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:38.662
now switch to blue

130
00:07:38.663 --> 00:07:46.624
draw a rectangle at the bottom lower, right in corner 

131
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:57.712
and finaly, with green make a !scribble! path between the two

132
00:07:57.713 --> 00:08:01.463
!???! now you've done now, you're gonna hide the interface

133
00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:08.090
with the tab button

134
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:15.095
and your goal is to begin by zooming in, to let the triangle fit  the whole screen

135
00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:21.003
and use the "pan" key, the space bar, if you need to recenter

136
00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:25.096
and then follow this !squiggle! path

137
00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:28.178
all the way down

138
00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:31.986
to find the rectangle at the end

139
00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:36.194
and then zoom out, to review the whole document

140
00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:41.792
and then try it again, zoom in on the triangle

141
00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:48.164
follow along the line

142
00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:51.073
and then zoom out to review your whole document

143
00:08:51.074 --> 00:08:54.000
now as !??! incredibely !remainery!

144
00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.191
to believe me

145
00:08:55.192 --> 00:08:57.165
get in really !???! with

146
00:08:57.166 --> 00:09:01.741
zoom in panel who make anything else about photoshop easier

﻿<br/><h2>2.Video Content</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

Part 1: Introduction

Want to learn to make concept art but don’t know where to start? This series will help you get your feet wet. Because the skillset is rooted in traditional drawing and painting, don’t expect to be the next superstar concept artist overnight. Instead, think of this 101 course as an opportunity to get to know the tools. Over these five short lessons I’ll show you what you need to get started on the path of digital painting.

You’ve probably seen your fair share of concept art on the internet. Whether you’re looking at a sprawling Martian landscape or a craggy cave troll it’s likely that a concept artist is responsible. Though this creation process is involved and fast paced it can be distilled into two basic parts: design and execution. The first portion, design, is the deeply imaginative act. How many horns should the elder dragon have? What shape is the alien life form? Concept artists work long and hard to create originality. Creativity of this sort is hard to teach. The second portion, execution, is what this series focuses on.

Download the Software

Before you get started, you’re going to need Adobe Photoshop – and the official website has a 30 day free trial. Once you’re familiar with the basic principles, you may decide that Photoshop Elements ($99) or the GIMP ($0) is a better fit for your budget, but for this series I’ll be using Adobe Photoshop CS5.

Lose the Mouse

Traditional painters use brushes and pencils, and digital artist use USB tablets. Other than the pen-like form factor, these digitizers differ from computer mice in one key aspect: pressure sensitivity. While a mouse is only capable of a binary clicking action, the USB tablet outputs a gradation of intensity. Press hard with one of these pens and you get a dark line; ease up to lighten your mark.
[dp101_01_b.jpg]

The most common USB tablet brand is Wacom, and they offer an entry level “Bamboo” model which provides great value for the sub-$100 price-point. Though I occasionally hear stories of a digital painter opting to use a mouse, it is quite rare. To follow along with this series you’ll be well served to have a USB tablet of some sort.
Welcome to Photoshop
[dp101_01_c.jpg]

Used for a variety of graphic tasks, Photoshop is dense software filled with menus and options galore. Generally speaking, however, digital painting requires only a small fraction of these offerings. Knowing which parts to display and which parts to hide will make your challenge much easier! Let’s begin by creating a new document.  When prompted with the new document dialog, enter the following settings to match those shown here.

Before we go any further, it’s time to define a few things. In Photoshop terms, a palette is a free-floating window which contains information. When you open the window menu, you can reveal or hide the palettes. A check mark means that it’s now visible. The vertical palette on the left side of the screen is called the “tool palette”. I’ll select the brush tool by clicking on the brush icon.

Tool Properties

Whenever you have a tool selected, the information shown in the top bar will change. This is called the Tool Properties. In this case, there are three different properties which modify the brush tool. If your Tool Properties bar looks different than mine, you might have a different tool active.
[dp101_01_e.jpg]

Color Picker

Near the bottom of the tool palette, you’ll see two squares of color – potentially black and white. These are called the foreground and background color. The color on your brush is known as the ‘foreground color’. If you want to change this color, click on the foreground square and it opens up the color picker.

Getting Set Up

Now that you know some of the basics of the interface, it’s time to get set up for painting. The necessary palettes to have displayed are the following: Navigator, Layers, Tools

The Navigator will serve as your roadmap. It displays a thumbnail sized version of your canvas, and allows you to zoom and pan. The small and large mountain buttons control the zoom, and the red rectangle can be dragged around to pan your canvas when zoomed in. You can position these palettes wherever you like, but I like to keep them on the left side of my window. This layout works well for me because I am right handed.

Keyboard Shortcuts for Getting Around

Sometimes operating software feels like digging through a dense instruction manual. You’re attempting to do a creative act, but getting bogged down by an endless sea of menus and pulldowns. What better way to speed up your painting than with keyboard shortcuts? These shortcuts* aren’t very flashy, but they’re worth learning before you progress any further.

*I’m a PC user, so if you use a Mac replace each instance of ‘Ctrl’ with ‘command’.

    Zoom: To quickly zoom in and out, press Ctrl+ + and Ctrl+ -
    Pan: If you’re zoomed in to a portion of your canvas, hold down Spacebar to temporarily switch to the Hand tool, and left click drag to move your canvas around.
    Hide the Interface: Need more space? Hide the UI with the Tab button. To reveal it, hit the Tab button a second time.

Knowing these shortcuts is especially useful if you like the minimalism of a hidden UI. All keyboard shortcuts work regardless if their button-counterpart is visible, so you can zoom and pan to your heart’s content with the interface hidden. Painting full-screen with the user interface hidden has a certain elegance – and might blow some minds at a the coffee shop.
Review

If this is your first experience with Photoshop you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed. Don’t worry, everyone feels this way when they dive into new software. To review the concepts covered in this lesson I’ve created a simple drill.

Homework: Basic Navigation drill

    1) Draw a red triangle in the upper left hand portion of your canvas.
    2) Change your color to blue, and draw a rectangle in the lower right quadrant.
    3) Change your color to green and draw a squiggle connecting the two shapes.
    4) Hide the interface with the TAB key, and zoom into your canvas with Ctrl+ + so only the red triangle is visible.
    5) Pan your visible canvas while holding the SPACBAR to follow the squiggle path toward the blue rectangle.
    6) Once the blue rectangle is visible, zoom out to show your entire canvas with Ctrl+ -
    7) Repeat this sequence until you feel comfortable with basic navigation!
