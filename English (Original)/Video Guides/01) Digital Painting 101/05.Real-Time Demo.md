Part 5: Demo

For the final installment of digital painting 101 I showcase each of the previous techniques in an illustration demo. The speed of this video is different than the previous four installments: it’s a time lapse which allows me to cover more ground. The entire process is narrated – beginning with a scanned drawing and ending in a finished painting.
As you watch the demo, keep an eye out for these key techniques:

    The ‘basic 3′ brushes
    ‘Temp layers’
    mini-palette
    opaque layers, glaze layers
    On-screen mixing
    Heavy use of keyboard shortcuts
    Where to next?

Congratulations on completing digital painting 101!  Now you’re ready to take on the world of concept art. The rest of the videos can be found in the Library and the Store.  Have fun!
