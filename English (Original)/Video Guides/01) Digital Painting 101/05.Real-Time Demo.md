00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,001
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:13,145
this is the fifth and final
section of Digital Painting 101

3
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:14,708
at this point you've
made it thought

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,170
all the basic technics

5
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,505
that I use to make the
following illustration

6
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:21,407
so in the next few minutes I
gonna go from this line drawing

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,569
to this finished illustration

8
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,664
and the format of this video
is gonna be a bit different

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,782
in all we covered a lot of ground,
and then show them all at time

10
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,694
I've done an entire illustration

11
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,520
and I speed the video up

12
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,755
I'll be narring it over
the top about idea

13
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:39,838
now it's gonna move pretty quickly, see
want be on the site every brush tool I make

14
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,882
but I made sure to use
only those technics

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,922
that I've… talk…

16
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,390
in lessons one trought four

17
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:47,769
so they won't be
any actual tricks

18
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,809
everything that I haven't
shown you how to do

19
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:52,630
because to show to you !contains!
simple technics

20
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:53,948
and get a lot from them

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,777
so as I work you'll
gonna see one process

22
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:58,849
over and over

23
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,853
that's what I
describe Temp's layer

24
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:04,674
so this is when I'm
taking a big soft brush

25
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,066
and painting way
outside of the lines

26
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,574
and then erasing the
way that I don't want

27
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:12,856
but the crucial part of this
is it all done on a new layer

28
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,972
and I use that layer
temporarily, make a new layer

29
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:17,821
paint on it, carving it

30
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:20,238
and when I am happy with
it, I flat them down

31
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,369
so here you see, that I'm

32
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:25,773
often starting way outside the lines
and it's got a big fuzzy shape

33
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,390
to pen slowly the sheet
start surely fine

34
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,851
so it's of course speed
up in this video

35
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,403
what I'm doing is using
a hard round eraser

36
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:35,006
and curving that edge back

37
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,511
so I can see sharp
edges I'm looking for

38
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:42,388
see now this is a starting here I'm
thinking about the large masses first

39
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:44,765
nothing come up as
small details at all

40
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,733
I'm thinking of the
whole of the sheet

41
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,039
as a giant !surrender!

42
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,483
I'm gonna all along the lines

43
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,295
and here I'm starting the add on

44
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,509
the small masses

45
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,268
so I add a light source

46
00:01:57,554 --> 00:02:00,025
I'm gonan erase it away,
to reveal the shadow on it

47
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,744
once I've !stepisch! for large masses, I
can begin to add the specular hard lights

48
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,052
this is…

49
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,250
this is what really help
to find the surface

50
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:12,000
in this case it got some
of the mate finish paint

51
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,747
so it's gonna be
diffuse-reflective core detailed

52
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:17,458
wich !mind! it it does
have a shining reflection

53
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,013
but it is diffused

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,121
so hopely by now you've seen really there's
not a lot of trick, in this process

55
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:26,642
I'm doing one primary technic

56
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,746
one I like to call temp layers

57
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,026
as well as some on screen mixing

58
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:33,656
wich is using the eyedropper
tool with the brush tool

59
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,923
…to pick my colors,
and that's it!

60
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,513
here I'm begining to
add the cockpit glass

61
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,677
same deal, paint, large

62
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:45,312
and then carve it on the sheet

63
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,381
so I thought of the
big glass as one unit

64
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,055
and then later erase to way

65
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,994
the… separated border

66
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:55,182
and here I !begin decating!
what's on behind the glass

67
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,498
now in a moment here

68
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,983
at wich point right color
enough of the canvas

69
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,498
and I feel !contable!,
I flatten the image

70
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,377
I don't need to worry about, working
on the limit of my layer anymore

71
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,525
I can work over the
top of everything

72
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,191
and not worry about
making the sticks

73
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,307
and from this point forward

74
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,522
I don't have the ability
to use layers anymore

75
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,804
so what I'm doing is I'm gonna painting
over the top over my lines work

76
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,792
to get ready some
of them selectively

77
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,514
part of retaining in
real lesson of on times

78
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,277
is getting ready your additional
additional line drawing

79
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:31,481
and from this one I'm gonna keep
some of that technics along work

80
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,350
it make sense in the
case of things with

81
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,278
seem lines, and !painters!,
but I don't want all of it

82
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:37,957
so having a flat image

83
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,417
clears my head, in the last
I gonna paint atop of it

84
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,557
without worrying

85
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,916
want to have a flat image, it's all the
time to restore by finding the edges

86
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,363
here on the side I add some
tear lights, over the sheet

87
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:09,898
so I've used the big…
soft round brush

88
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:12,711
and painting some red in,
I'm gonna erasing out

89
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,886
worry don't one of to be

90
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,410
those filling atop the
left side of my image

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,423
is a bit

92
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:19,534
too shadowed, and I
want to bring it back

93
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,459
some illumination

94
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:21,626
now I did wanna

95
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,610
take over the dominants spotlight
wich is my focus point

96
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:27,615
but I want to have some over
it, complementary light

97
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:47,130
now what I just do there is I made one
detailed object that's on one layer

98
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,400
and then I used it in multiple
spots around the sheet

99
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:51,912
this is wich save time

100
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:54,507
so I can spend a few
minutes drawing it once

101
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,408
and then use it on very
!possibility! image

102
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:58,754
I hear you know the step

103
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,484
of the painting that I'm
doing is detail work

104
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:05,751
before I flat the image I make sure
that I'm happy with the overal value

105
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,071
the image as to work
on that large scale

106
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,329
before you can take it down,
and work on the !meticuly!

107
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,848
so is once at the stade wich all
of this lining I am happy with

108
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,951
then I can go and !???!
around them

109
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,097
painting borders in

110
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,335
putting a rivets

111
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:20,904
this all so when I

112
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,158
carve out and refine
the important sheets

113
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,488
and let the other sheets
proceding in the shadow

114
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,864
in seems my process involve using
so many soft round brushes

115
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,832
this is all so in, at
time when I like to

116
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,321
bring back some sharpeness

117
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:36,424
and paint with some hard round
brushes, and some hard flat brushes

118
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,034
this is not a lot
of secrets tools

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,907
just repeat thoses
steps over and over

120
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,405
and with some practice, you'll be
making anything like this in no time

121
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,521
so now the income into
Digital Painting 101

122
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,402

more information

123
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,815

﻿<br/><h2>2.Video Content</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

Part 5: Demo

For the final installment of digital painting 101 I showcase each of the previous techniques in an illustration demo. The speed of this video is different than the previous four installments: it’s a time lapse which allows me to cover more ground. The entire process is narrated – beginning with a scanned drawing and ending in a finished painting.
As you watch the demo, keep an eye out for these key techniques:

    The ‘basic 3′ brushes
    ‘Temp layers’
    mini-palette
    opaque layers, glaze layers
    On-screen mixing
    Heavy use of keyboard shortcuts
    Where to next?

Congratulations on completing digital painting 101!  Now you’re ready to take on the world of concept art. The rest of the videos can be found in the Library and the Store.  Have fun!
