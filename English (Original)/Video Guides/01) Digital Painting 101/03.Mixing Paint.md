00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,001
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:12,627
in this third video I'm gonna describe
one of the most important concept's

3
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:13,946
of painting in photoshop

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:15,461
witch is Mixing Paint

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,870
and the way I'm gonna do this is primarily
realise upon one of the keyboard shortcuts

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,377
that the last video describe
about the brush tool

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,821
witch is the Alt Key

8
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,943
becoming the eyedropper tool

9
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:30,229
so you know in this finished
example, you have a little ball

10
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,557
to chose light,
proceding in the shadow

11
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,072
and to cross that transition there's
a overal idea of colors that come up

12
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:44,248
so as you are painting you gonna need
to be able to go from, one color

13
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:48,687
into a second color, to
create that transition

14
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:53,066
with the brush tool, and this is the
process that's know as on screen mixing

15
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:58,598
now the steps of this process,
are really very simple,

16
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:01,262
they do have to take a
little while to get used too

17
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:05,513
and your final is something you're comes
doing while painting, so track practice

18
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:07,177
so the steps go as follows

19
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:10,970
if you goes to, start
with color A on the left

20
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,853
and then with color
B on the right

21
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:19,867
you begin by painting, a
bit of A, in the middle

22
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,983
and make sure you're flow,
wich is the Brush property,

23
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:27,018
is turned down about 50%

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,692
that make less pigments come on
you're brush at any given time

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,192
so then you select B

26
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,152
and you paint over the top a bit

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,104
and now as you paint on top of it you see
an overal idea of different colors result

28
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:50,859
so I'm gonna pick one that's look pretty much
like, a middle mixture between thoses two

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,537
and I simply hold the Alt Key,
and then I paint a little more

30
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,378
I know that this is a really
enough to paint them up

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,596
so a simple A

32
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,992
paint down the top, that's look
like more of a middle mixture

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,869
maybe it's get a
little more like that

34
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:10,611
of the B color

35
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:17,801
so here's I gone from A to
B, and from the middle point

36
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,354
while I never opened
the color picker

37
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:21,759
and the way I do this is
holding down the alt key

38
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,839
this is the eyedropper
to sample the color

39
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,402
and I begin painting
with that new color

40
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,653
when in other painting works

41
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:31,843
one of the first things I
do when starting painting

42
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,819
Is to pretty mix colors

43
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:35,073
on a physical palette

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,375
now because you're working with photoshop,
you don't have to worry about paint drawing

45
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,184
so you don't really
need to do this

46
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:42,949
but I do that !at actively!

47
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,224
really better !fisher!

48
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:48,462
to go ahead and mix, the colors that you want
to use in you're compositions ahead of time

49
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:50,896
so when I work

50
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,079
all of the times I make
what I call a mini-palette

51
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,297
and in this case

52
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,676
it's a layer that I
can toggle and hide

53
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,205
or can move around

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,848
to painting and realise
working on my painting

55
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,900
and it's just like an
other painter's palette

56
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,505
and now know what you do about

57
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:11,156
on screen mixing

58
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:13,514
and using the eyedropper
tool while using the brush

59
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,223
you can see why this
is really useful

60
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,356
cause I can keep it

61
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,670
on a corner of my screen

62
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:20,968
and then as I paint

63
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,731
I can touch my brush,
using the Alt Key

64
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:25,814
to my mini-palette

65
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,033
and grab colors that I want
to have in my illustration

66
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,048
and in this way I am saving
myself the time to constantly

67
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,378
open up the color picker window

68
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:38,100
changing the color

69
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,071
and clicking OK

70
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:44,726
and one other additional bonus of this manner
use, is that you up with a color palette

71
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,997
that's more consistent
across your image

72
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:49,121
if you chose the
colors ahead of time

73
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,637
you more likely end up with

74
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,640
nice pleasing color skins

75
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,849
than if you just, dived-in in

76
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,508
so while picking colors randomly

77
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,130
and then as you work

78
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,990
the image itself while
become a bit of a palette

79
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,882
and you can sample
from now as you go

80
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:08,038
and in each of the previous videos,
I !vending! with the preview sheet

81
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:12,263
to help's a little find some of the new
concepts that I come across the lesson

82
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:13,885
in this sheet

83
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,316
you may see someting a little familiar
if you've been at a Art School

84
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,915
mixing color swatches

85
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,069
is one of the core practices

86
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,426
when it comes to mixing paint

87
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:26,493
so I'm gonna give you
an example, on the

88
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,884
top layer, and you can
do the rest yourself

89
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:36,797
so you're only !aloud!
the sample from the, A

90
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,174
and see, colors that I provided

91
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,983
the rest you can
remake same yourself

92
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,614
and you never gonna have to open the
color picker's for this whole time

93
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:47,848
so I suggest setting
your flow to about 50%

94
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:50,090
and use the Hard Round Brush

95
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,522
so the first step

96
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,531
is to try and make

97
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,058
a copy of B

98
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,099
the middle mixture
between A and C

99
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,563
so I'm sampling first from A

100
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:07,289
and then painting some of C
on top of the !interval you!

101
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,325
and here's look just about right

102
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,369
now you may I got this exact

103
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,567
but it's really need practice

104
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,365
for the can of

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,722
real world painting
that you've been doing

106
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,106
before too long

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,253
so want's you happy with B

108
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,960
you're gonna divide
that, further in half

109
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,470
by mixing between… A

110
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,689
and B to create a little mixture

111
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,273
to match the, above example

112
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,702
and then finaly between B and C

113
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:55,473
I now that some
never samplig from

114
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:56,731
the example

115
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,056
only from the mixtures I've made

116
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,060
and A & C !???! provided

117
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:13,921
so the !???! that I've
made, been particulary

118
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,313
clean as I do this

119
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:17,599
but before when I clean-up
my edges at the very end

120
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,848
I can sample from the
background color, to gray

121
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:22,845
hold down Shift

122
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,147
and paint the hard
edges across it

123
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,839
so go ahead and use this
sheet, to give a try

124
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,835
in each example you
gonna go from… A

125
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,338
to C… creating B

126
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,913
and then have a point
between, A & B, and B & C

127
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,472
do this sheet a few times to find a much
better mixing that you have when you started

128
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:50,508
have fun !

﻿<br/><h2>2.Video Content</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the text shown below the video in the CtrlPaint library.

As one color approaches another there’s always a blended transition. Even if your subject is painted a single color it will have lighter and darker areas. Because color is affected by light and form, it has a huge amount of variation. Even a sheet of white paper seen on a cloudy day contains a gradation subtle colors.

So what does this mean for you?

It means that you’re going to be doing a lot of blending. As a general rule, photoshop does not do a great job of imitating the way real paint blends. If you have traditional painting experience, be prepared to learn some techniques that will seem quite foreign. Don’t worry – Photoshop will do a great job blending colors, but the method is uniquely digital.

One color into another

In this simple example you can see two primary colors: highlight and shadow. Where the form turns away from the light there’s a color transition.

On-Screen Mixing with the brush tool

The secret to painting a color transition lies in the brush tool + eyedropper. As you learned in lesson #2 the alt key will temporarily call up the eyedropper while the brush tool is active. ‘Sampling’ in this way gives you an incredible power that traditional painters would kill for. To create a middle mixture between two colors use the following steps:
[mixing_diagram.png]

Sample color A and paint a swatch of it in the middle.  Sample color B and paint it lightly over top of the middle swatch. To paint with this middle mixture, sample it with the alt button! This process is known as ‘on-screen mixing’ and is quintessential for digital painting. It’s not similar to painting with oils, but will quickly feel intuitive. When using this on-screen mixing technique, you’ll experience two major bonuses to your workflow:

Save tons of time. Every time you avoid opening the color picker window time is saved. To maximize this effect, use the eyedropper (alt) tool as much as you can.

Create a unified color scheme. If you are primarily mixing on the canvas, your colors will naturally harmonize with one another through blending.

Using a ‘Mini-palette’

Traditional painters are required to pre-mix paints on their palettes before starting to work. In this way they are able to plan out a pleasing color scheme ahead of time. Digital artists aren’t forced to do this step because there’s no physical paint involved. Even though not strictly necessary, I would ague that pre-mixing digital colors is a worthwhile endeavor.

When starting a color painting, my first step is to create these pre-mixed colors on what I refer to as a ‘mini-palette’. It’s simply a blank layer that I title “palette” and paint small swatches on. Because it’s on a separate layer I’m able to move it around my canvas when it gets in the way, or to hide it completely with the visibility button.

The specifics of the mini-palette format are up to you. I like to keep mine small and unobtrusive. Some artists like to paint swatches of their main colors – but I like to include mixed gradations as well. Doing so gives me a pleasing color palette because middle mixtures have a nice neutralizing quality.

Mixing Productively

One of my main goals when approaching photoshop for concept art is efficiency. I’ve found the most success through a combination of on-screen mixing and sampling from a mini-palette. When both of these techniques are used, one can almost completely avoid the color picker window – and save a ton of time.

﻿<br/><h2>3.Homework</h2>
﻿@INFO: This is the translation of the Homework (when it's available).

Homework: Swatches

If you only take one thing away from this lesson it should be the power of the Alt key. What takes a traditional painter time and effort to mix is only a click away for photoshop users, so take full advantage.
The following worksheet might be a familiar sight to art school students. It’s not glamorous, but it’ll get you mixing accurately in no time. The goal is to use the principles of on-screen mixing to mimic the examples provided.

    1)  Sample from squares A and B to create middle mixture C
    2)  Find the middle mixture between A and C
    3)  Use the same technique to mix B and C
    4)  optional bonus: use the soft round brush to create smooth transitions between each color swatch

So save a copy of this sheet, and start mixing!
