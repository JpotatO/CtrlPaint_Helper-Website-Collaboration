00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:08,001
~Opening Theme~

2
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,764
this next section is gonna be all about layers

3
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,859
you probably !I do! that layers

4
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,105
that I've use them already

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,970
beacause that on one of photoshops

6
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:17,121
was !periferal tool!

7
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:18,812
the layer panel

8
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:22,175
on the left side of the screen represent's you're layer stack

9
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,768
you can think that this is a physical stack

10
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:26,117
with clear transparency

11
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:28,658
each of the sheet contain informations on you're drawings

12
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:32,027
so you see here I've supplied a triangle

13
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:35,199
a circle

14
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:36,889
the rectangle

15
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:38,686
into their own layers

16
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,007
so you can see the flexibility

17
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,206
over this give at painting

18
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,741
but the traditional painter really will never access to

19
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,042
we can work on

20
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:49,228
each objects, on a zone

21
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:51,462
and still have the freedom to move around

22
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,045
at the bottom of the layer panel

23
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,363
you have a button's that can create new layers

24
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,636
or create layer groups

25
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,736
you can consider a layer group as a bundle of layers

26
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,204
so if I… select

27
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:06,778
my three primary layers

28
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,337
and drag them all to the group one

29
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:12,920
now I can work with them as a unit

30
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:14,900
I can move them together

31
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,996
make an even free transform on them, as a unit

32
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:23,073
and so once you got a group

33
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:24,791
you can collapse

34
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,371
or expand

35
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:29,159
that group, on the layer panel, !for ???? ????!

36
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:34,499
it's all so important to know that the layer order does matter

37
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,867
this is why think of your layer stack

38
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:39,113
as a physical group of transparencies

39
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:40,513
can really help you out

40
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:43,358
because in this case !???! have the rectangle

41
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,128
on top of the triangle

42
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,036
just moving the layer around won't cut it

43
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,548
it's gonna always stay behind the triangle

44
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,834
so I wanna put the triangle

45
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:55,585
below the other sheets

46
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,905
I have to lower it in the layer order

47
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:00,278
and to do this I grab the name of the layer

48
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,139
and let it go

49
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,356
in the bottom of the stack !???! like

50
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,248
so you know this now that

51
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:09,909
the triangle's behind

52
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,060
the rectangle

53
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:13,525
and the circle is on top

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,395
so in this point you may be want drawing

55
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,675
other pratical application, of using the layers in a painting

56
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:23,448
!on one thing it open about better find it by!

57
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,084
is what's called the Blending Mode, on the layer

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,874
so we gonna make a new layer

59
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,215
with the default, normal style

60
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,029
and above the word normal

61
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,010
I'm gonna paint… with the…

62
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,668
median blue color

63
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:43,087
so look's like what you'd expect, it's opaque paint

64
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,234
now I'm gonna paint that same color

65
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,188
on a new layer, that's set to Multiply

66
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:51,853
and you can see the difference

67
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,654
now this have his has…

68
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,940
grease effect to it

69
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:58,057
in this way I multiply layer

70
00:02:58,082 --> 00:02:59,827
can be found about the grease leayer

71
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,607
and we lack to pick like

72
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,290
find a layers, or potentialy other color paint's

73
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:09,709
so when you make in !structs!, that's nice to think about why do you want opaque paint

74
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,252
wich will be a Normal layer

75
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,048
or greasing paint

76
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,620
wich will be a Multiply layer

77
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,046
so you've seen some of the positives

78
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,705
that extra layers can provide

79
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,510
then !if you! nice versatility

80
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,767
and then can to be set to different blending's modes

81
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:26,735
on the down side of layers

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,389
is when you get too many layers

83
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:30,335
so you can see here I made

84
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,197
about 40 layers

85
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:36,054
now I gonna scroll down from the layer panel

86
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,813
and the layers can be hard to keep track

87
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,594
additionaly when your composition gets really big

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,729
and more and more layers is in the !heft!

89
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,733
it becomes a giant file

90
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,130
that can be really hard for your computer to work with

91
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:51,340
specially if you got an older computer or !??? ??? ???!

92
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,782
you really want to afford having too many layers

93
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,158
so some to each hardest to figure out

94
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:57,579
the proper balance

95
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,491
for their workflow, between

96
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,315
just enough layer to keep it flexible

97
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,791
but not too many so you're computer gets work down

98
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:07,851
so… from… my properties

99
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,209
I've come up with a technique that I call

100
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,443
Temp Layers

101
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,845
so the idea of temp layers, is to generaly keep my layer's stack short

102
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,435
but when I need to do something risky, I paint this…

103
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,229
big gradation of blue

104
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,551
and make a new layer temporarily

105
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:24,329
sheep it

106
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,877
and then when I am happy with it, I merge it down

107
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,234
so I begin by making the shape

108
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,692
but I paint while outside the lines, to focus on the degradation

109
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,556
I then erase

110
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,786
to form, a crisp edge

111
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:49,033
and in this way I get that, smooth transition

112
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,734
is while the sharp edges

113
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,762
something !????! doing if you're painting on a single layer

114
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,787
and when I am happy with it

115
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,545
I flat my layer back dawn into my stack

116
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,883
so let's think about temp layer's in practice

117
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,291


118
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,561


119
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:10,319


120
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,370


121
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,508


122
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,813


123
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,268


124
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,590


125
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,979


126
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,158


127
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:32,602


128
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,575


129
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,194


130
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,384


131
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,040


132
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,064


133
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,076


134
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:00,500


135
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,098


136
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,336


137
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,757


138
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,356


139
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,834


140
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:20,639


141
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,237


142
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,864


143
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,164


144
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:31,469


145
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,327


146
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,196


147
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,672


148
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,104


149
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,878


150
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,516


151
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,511


152
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,179


153
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,851


154
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:57,049

00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,291

Part 4: Layers

Today’s installment of digital painting 101 is all about layers. Layers are one of the features that most dramatically separate traditional from digital painting. Knowing how to use layers to your advantage can give you great freedom as a digital painter. In this lesson I’ll introduce the fundamentals of the layer palette, as well as my thoughts on layer economy.

Layers Basics

Layers exist to keep elements on your canvas separate from one another so they can be edited independently. How you use this power is up to you – whether it’s an individual layer for each character in your illustration, or a layer for each brush stroke. To make a new layer, click the new layer button on the bottom of the layer palette.

Layer Order

The order in which the layers exist in your layers palette matters. You can think of it as a stack of transparent sheets of plastic – those on the top of the stack will block the contents directly underneath. To change this order, simply grab the title of the layer you want to move, and drag it it higher or lower in the stack.

Layer Groups

These can be thought of as a “bundle” of layers. A group is primarily an organizational tool. Like folders on your computer, they can be expanded or collapsed in the layer palette. Additionally, they can be moved and transformed as a group.

To create a layer group, click the new group button on the layers palette. Once You’ve created it, drag other layers onto it’s title to add them to the group. You’ll know they’re a part of the group once they’re indented on the layer stack. Layer sets can be nested.

Blending mode

So far the properties of layers have been pretty straightforward – but this gets a bit more complicated. The pulldown at the top of the layer stack describes the ‘blending mode’, which defaults to ‘Normal’. All of the other modes modify the way that the layer mixes with those below it in the stack. Most of the time I use two types of layers: Normal, and Multiply.

“Normal” layers are used for opaque painting, as in thick acrylics, gauche, or thick oils.

“Multiply” Layers are used for glazing with transparent paint – like watercolors or thin oils

The downside of a tall layer stack

Layers add flexibility. They allow you to separate your elements from one another. The drawback, however, is that each added layer increases the file-size and amount of RAM used to manipulate the file. Additionally, a tall layer stack makes for a long scrollbar on the layers palette – leading to much wasted time in navigation. Each artist must find a comfortable balance between flexibility and reasonable file sizes.

My personal layer strategy – a.k.a ‘temp layers’

When working with written documents, do you ever find yourself saving every time you’re pleased with the state of the paper? You probably do this because it protects you against a potential future mistake. If you make a mistake it’s not a problem because you have the most recent save to fall back on.
This general concept is at the heart of my layer strategy. In the long term I like to keep my layer stack short, but in the short term I make a new layer whenever I want to take a risk. This means that every time I want to add a large feature of some sort I make a new layer. If I mess it up in some way, it’s not a problem: I just delete the layer. If I like it, I flatten the layer down onto the rest of the stack. In this way I have the best of both worlds: short for easy computing, and plenty of new layers for confident painting.
In this example my goal is to paint the unfinished plate on thie robot’s chest with a smooth blue gradation. Here’s a breakdown of my usual process (temp layers):

    1) Make a new blank layer (normal blending mode)
    2) Using the Soft Round brush I paint way outside of the lines. Not worrying about drawing inside the lines makes my brushwork much more confident
    3) Using a hard eraser I erase away what I don’t want. In this case, the paint that fell outside of the lines.
    4) Once I’m satisfied with the result, I use the ‘Layer> Merge Down’ command (Ctrl+E) to flatten this into my layer stack.

The example shows how my workflow allows for large, smooth transitions and simultaneously crisp edges. If I were painting on a single layer the entire time It would be very difficult to achieve this result. I don’t constantly add new layers – not for every stroke. If I’m noodling on small details I will keep it on one layer. Adding a new temp layer is only for large areas of color, or times where a clean edge is critical.

Homework : ‘Temp Layers’ worksheet

You’ve covered a lot of territory in this lesson. I’ve attached a worksheet drill for you to practice these new techniques on. It will mainly focus on the ‘temp layers’ workflow. Your goal is to paint smooth gradations on under each of these organic shapes I’ve provided. You should work with Normal (opaque) layers. Also, remember to make a new ‘temp layer’ for each shape, and merge it down (Ctrl + E) when you’re satisfied. The end result will be a single painting layer above the background.
